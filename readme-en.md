# Description 

This game has been out for over a year now, and the developer disappeared in the middle of last year, leaving behind a game full of bugs. I think it's a shame, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and try to fix some of the really nasty bugs that affect the game experience by decompiling and recompiling the IL files. Although I haven't learned C#, nor do I have any game programming experience, fortunately my main programming language is C++, which has many similarities in syntax with C#. So I don't feel much pressure when reading the game's code. Currently, it's known that this patch has successfully fixed the issue of disappearing laser weapon projectiles. In theory, it should apply to all weapons that have the problem of projectiles disappearing, but due to my limited time, I couldn't test them all. If I have free time in the future, I will try to fix more bugs and update them in this guide.
